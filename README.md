# SnapChan
**This project is NOT ready for usage.**

Lisp code to create screencaps of 4chan threads.

All configurations are done from ```config.lisp```

Details about posts are programmed from ```capture.lisp```

Run ```main.lisp``` to obtain the final screencap.

**Warning:** This program is very cache heavy. Make sure there is a lot of disk space in your ```MAGICK_TMPDIR```.
